This is a Web - based Decision Support System that recommends text - editor themes, based on the user's ratings. The user will be asked to rate themes that are randomly generated, to personalize the recommendations according to his/her preference. The selected theme can be integrated into a text editor by using the generated Red-Green-Blue(RGB) values. This is designed and implemented using Neural Networks.
